## 📋 Propagation Summary

Today’s HF propagation is shaped by a strong solar flux (172) and a healthy sunspot number (152), both supporting robust ionospheric conditions. However, a moderately elevated K-index (3.3) signals some geomagnetic unrest, which may cause mild absorption and fading, especially on polar and high-latitude paths. Expect the best band performance on 20m through 15m, with 10m and 12m showing daytime promise but closing at night. Operators should anticipate generally good DX opportunities during daylight, but be prepared for variable conditions as geomagnetic activity fluctuates. Early mornings and late afternoons will be prime time for long-haul contacts, while night favors the lower bands.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- Focus on 20m, 17m, and 15m for reliable daytime DX—these bands are wide open thanks to high solar flux.
- Use 10m and 12m during daylight for potential short and mid-distance openings, but expect these bands to close quickly after sunset.
- For evening and night, shift to 40m and 80m for regional and intercontinental contacts, though expect some noise and fading due to geomagnetic activity.
- Use digital modes (FT8, FT4) to punch through marginal conditions, especially on higher bands or during periods of absorption.
- If you’re in high latitudes, monitor for auroral effects—signals may be fluttery or enhanced on VHF.
- Keep an eye on real-time K-index updates; sudden jumps may signal shortwave fadeouts or auroral propagation.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m & 40m:** Best at night and early morning for regional and some DX; avoid daytime due to absorption.
- **20m, 17m, 15m:** Excellent from sunrise to late afternoon for global DX; still usable into the evening.
- **12m & 10m:** Peak from late morning to mid-afternoon; close rapidly after sunset.
- **Grayline (dawn/dusk):** All bands may see enhanced long-path propagation—try 40m and 20m at sunrise/sunset.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Daytime:** Strong F-layer support means 20m–15m are open for worldwide DX, including trans-equatorial and east-west paths.
- **Grayline:** Enhanced propagation on 40m and 20m—look for rare DX along the sunrise/sunset terminator.
- **Evening/Night:** 40m and 80m open for intercontinental paths, especially toward regions in darkness.
- **Special Events:** Watch for possible auroral propagation on VHF/UHF if K-index rises further.
- **Contest/DXpeditioners:** Focus on 15m and 17m for high QSO rates; check 10m for surprise openings.

20m, 17m, and 15m are the most reliable bands throughout the day and into the evening, offering consistent DX and domestic contacts. 10m and 12m are open and productive during daylight but close rapidly after sunset. 80m and 40m are best reserved for nighttime and early morning, with daytime absorption limiting their use. For maximum coverage, operate on 20m–15m during the day and transition to 40m/80m after dark.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.GaugePanelChart}}

- **K-index (Geomagnetic Activity):** 3.3 (moderate)  
  - Some geomagnetic instability; minor absorption and fading possible, especially on polar paths.
- **Solar Flux (10.7cm):** 172 (high)  
  - Excellent F-layer ionization; supports strong propagation on upper HF bands (20m–10m).
- **Sunspot Number:** 152 (high)  
  - Indicates robust solar activity, favoring good band openings and DX.
- **Space Weather:**  
  - X-ray flux at C1.3 (minor flare activity—watch for shortwave fadeouts if it increases).
  - Solar wind speed elevated (547.7 km/s); can contribute to geomagnetic activity.
  - Aurora index at 3; minor auroral effects possible at high latitudes.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

- The K-index has trended upward over the past 24 hours, peaking at 3.33.
- This moderate geomagnetic activity can cause some signal fading, especially on high-latitude and polar paths.
- Expect slightly increased noise and absorption on lower bands (80m/40m) during geomagnetic peaks.
- If the K-index rises above 4, watch for auroral propagation on VHF and sudden HF blackouts.

## 🌟 Space Weather Details

{{.SpaceWeatherDashboardChart}}

- **X-ray Activity**: Currently at C1.3 level (minor flare activity). This is below the threshold for HF blackouts, but watch for any increases to M-class levels which could cause sudden shortwave fadeouts during daylight hours.

- **Solar Wind**: Elevated at 547.7 km/s, which is contributing to the moderate geomagnetic activity. This faster-than-normal solar wind can enhance aurora activity and cause increased absorption on polar paths.

- **Particle Environment**: Electron flux at 1670 and proton flux at 40 indicate moderate particle activity. Higher electron flux can enhance VHF/UHF propagation via auroral scatter for northern operators, while elevated proton flux may cause increased noise on HF.

- **Aurora Activity**: Current level at 3 suggests minor auroral activity. Northern operators (especially in Canada, Alaska, and northern US states) may notice enhanced VHF/UHF signals via auroral reflection, but also possible flutter and distortion on HF signals.

- **Helium Line**: At 146.8, indicating stable solar activity with no major eruptions expected in the near term. This correlates well with the current solar flux readings.
