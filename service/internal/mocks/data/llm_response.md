## 📋 Propagation Summary

HF propagation is looking _very promising_ today thanks to a **high solar flux** (172) and **robust sunspot numbers** (174), both supporting strong ionization for higher bands. The **K-index** is at 3–3.7, indicating _moderate geomagnetic activity_—not stormy, but enough to slightly impact polar and high-latitude paths. Expect **excellent conditions on 20m, 17m, and 15m** throughout the day, with 12m and 10m also open for daytime DX. Lower bands (80m/40m) will be _noisy and less reliable_ during daylight but improve after sunset. Take advantage of the higher bands for long-haul DX and keep an eye on grayline openings for enhanced propagation.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Daytime:** Focus on 20m, 17m, 15m, and 12m for DX—these bands are wide open and offer the best SNR.
- **Night:** Shift to 40m and 80m as the higher bands close; digital modes (FT8, PSK31) will help cut through noise.
- **Modes:** Use CW and digital for weak-signal work, especially on lower bands or during geomagnetic upticks.
- **Contesters:** Run high bands during the day for fast rates, but don’t neglect 40m/80m after dark.
- **Antennas:** Directional antennas on 15m/12m/10m will yield great results; verticals will shine on 20m and below.
- **DXers:** Watch for grayline paths at sunrise/sunset for surprise openings, especially on 40m and 20m.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m/40m:** Best after sunset and before sunrise (night, early morning)
- **20m:** Good all day, especially late morning through afternoon
- **17m/15m:** Excellent from mid-morning to late afternoon
- **12m/10m:** Open mid-morning to late afternoon, especially for trans-equatorial and east-west paths
- **Grayline:** 40m and 20m are prime for grayline DX at local sunrise/sunset

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m/17m/15m:** Expect worldwide DX, including long-path to Asia/Pacific and Africa during daylight.
- **12m/10m:** Look for transatlantic and transpacific openings, especially around local noon and early afternoon.
- **Grayline:** Enhanced propagation on 40m and 20m at sunrise/sunset—target antipodal and polar paths.
- **Special:** Slightly elevated K-index may trigger brief auroral propagation on VHF for northern stations.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| **Band** | **Morning** | **Day** | **Evening** | **Night** |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| 80m      | 🔴 Poor     | 🔴 Poor | 🟠 Fair     | 🟠 Fair   |
| 40m      | 🔴 Poor     | 🔴 Poor | 🟠 Fair     | 🟠 Fair   |
| 20m      | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good   |
| 17m      | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good   |
| 15m      | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good   |
| 12m      | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good     | 🔴 Poor   |
| 10m      | 🟡 Good     | 🟡 Good | 🟡 Good     | 🔴 Poor   |

20m, 17m, and 15m are **consistently good** all day and into the evening, making them the top choices for reliable DX and domestic contacts. **12m and 10m** are also _good_ during daylight and early evening, but expect them to close at night. **80m and 40m** are _poor_ during the day due to D-layer absorption but become _fair_ after dark—best for local and regional contacts or digital weak-signal work.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.GaugePanelChart}}

- **K-index:** 3–3.7 (_moderate_)—some geomagnetic disturbance, especially at higher latitudes, but not stormy.
- **Solar Flux:** 172 (_very strong_)—supports excellent ionization, especially on higher bands (15m/12m/10m).
- **Sunspot Number:** 174 (_high_)—indicates a very active sun, boosting MUF and band openings.
- **Space Weather:** X-ray at C1.3 (minor flare activity), solar wind at 571.7 km/s (elevated, but not extreme).

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

The **K-index** has gradually increased over the past 24 hours, moving from quiet (1–2) to moderately unsettled (3–3.7). This trend suggests slightly more absorption and possible auroral effects at high latitudes, but overall conditions remain _stable_ for most HF work. No major geomagnetic storms are present, so expect only minor disruptions on polar paths.

## 🌟 Space Weather Details

{{.SpaceWeatherDashboardChart}}

- **X-ray Activity:** C1.3—_minor solar flare activity_; no significant HF blackouts expected, but brief fadeouts possible.
- **Solar Wind:** 571.7 km/s—_elevated speed_ can enhance geomagnetic activity, especially if the IMF turns southward.
- **Particle Environment:** Electron flux at 1530 and proton flux at 14—_normal to slightly elevated_; minimal impact on HF except during sudden spikes.
- **Aurora Activity:** 1—_very low_, so auroral propagation on VHF is unlikely except at far northern latitudes.
- **Helium Line:** 147.0—_stable_, indicating steady solar activity with no major upswings or drops.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline & Technical Details

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

Recent months show a **steady increase in solar flux and sunspot numbers** after a dip in May/June, now reaching some of the highest values of the year. This trend has improved MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency), opening up higher bands for longer periods each day.
