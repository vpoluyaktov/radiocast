## 📋 Propagation Summary

HF propagation is looking lively today thanks to robust solar activity: solar flux is at 172 and sunspot numbers are high at 152, both excellent for upper HF bands. The geomagnetic field is moderately unsettled, with the K-index hovering around 3, so expect some minor absorption or fading, especially at higher latitudes and during local daytime. Daytime conditions are particularly strong on 20m through 10m, with 12m and 10m showing good potential for DX, while 80m and 40m are best reserved for nighttime use. Operators should take advantage of the current solar peak, but keep an eye out for short-term geomagnetic upticks that could briefly dampen propagation on the higher bands. Overall, it's a great day for HF—get on the air and chase those DX contacts!

## 💡 Operator Tips

- Focus your efforts on 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m during daylight hours for the best DX and intercontinental contacts.
- Use digital modes (FT8, FT4, RTTY) on 10m and 12m to exploit even marginal openings, especially during midday.
- For local and regional QSOs, try 40m and 80m after sunset when D-layer absorption drops.
- If you’re in northern latitudes, be aware of possible auroral flutter on higher bands due to the moderate K-index.
- Keep antennas for higher bands (10m–20m) ready and consider verticals or beams for best DX performance.
- Monitor grayline times for enhanced long-path openings, especially on 40m and 20m.
- Contest and DXers: logbook those rare ones while the solar numbers are hot!

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m & 40m:** Best after sunset and through the night; avoid daytime due to high absorption.
- **30m:** Good all day and night, but strongest at dusk and dawn.
- **20m:** Excellent sunrise to sunset, with extended openings into the evening.
- **17m & 15m:** Peak performance mid-morning through late afternoon.
- **12m & 10m:** Best from late morning to mid-afternoon; watch for short, sporadic E-skip openings.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Daytime:** 15m, 12m, and 10m are open for trans-equatorial and east-west DX, especially between continents.
- **Grayline:** Enhanced propagation on 40m and 20m during local sunrise and sunset—look for long-path Asia-Pacific and South America.
- **Special Events:** With high solar flux, expect surprise openings on 10m and 12m, including possible short-path polar routes.
- **Auroral Activity:** Moderate K-index may bring auroral propagation on 6m and 10m at high latitudes—check for fluttery signals.

**Analysis:**  
Daytime is dominated by strong conditions on 20m, 17m, and 15m, with 12m and 10m also showing good potential for DX, especially around local noon. 80m and 40m are largely closed during the day but come alive after sunset, making them ideal for nighttime ragchews and regional nets. 30m offers reliable all-day performance for both DX and domestic contacts.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.GaugePanelChart}}

- **K-index (Geomagnetic Activity):** Currently at 3 (unsettled). This means minor disturbances—watch for some fading and absorption, especially at higher latitudes.
- **Solar Flux (10.7cm):** 172 (very high). Indicates excellent ionization of the upper atmosphere, supporting strong propagation on 20m–10m.
- **Sunspot Number:** 152 (high). More sunspots mean more chances for strong, stable HF propagation and frequent DX openings.
- **Space Weather Overview:** No major solar flares reported, but the elevated K-index suggests some minor geomagnetic unrest.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

- The K-index has been mostly between 1 and 3 over the last 24 hours, with a slight uptick to 3.33 recently.
- This level of geomagnetic activity is typical for unsettled conditions: expect some QSB (fading), especially on polar and high-latitude paths.
- No geomagnetic storms, but keep an eye on real-time reports for sudden changes.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline & Technical Details

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- 24-hour overview shows peak propagation on upper HF bands during daylight, with lower bands (80m, 40m) improving rapidly after sunset.
- Expect the best DX on 20m–10m from late morning through early evening.
- Technical note: D-layer absorption is strong during the day on lower bands, but E and F-layer ionization is excellent for high bands.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar Activity:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers are forecast to remain high, supporting continued strong HF conditions.
- **Geomagnetic Field:** K-index may remain slightly elevated (2–3), so minor disturbances are possible, but no major storms expected.
- **HF Bands:** 20m–10m will continue to offer excellent daytime DX. 80m and 40m will be best at night. Watch for surprise 10m/12m openings.
- **Operator Advice:** Stay flexible—monitor real-time band conditions and be ready to switch bands as needed. Take advantage of grayline and mid-day high-band openings for rare DX. Digital modes will help you work weak or marginal signals, especially during minor geomagnetic upticks.
