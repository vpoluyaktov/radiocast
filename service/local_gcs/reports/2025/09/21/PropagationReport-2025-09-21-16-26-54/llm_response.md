## 📋 Propagation Summary

HF propagation is looking excellent today! Solar flux is moderate at 100 with high sunspot activity (133), and geomagnetic conditions are quiet (K=1.3). This combination creates very favorable conditions for HF communication. Expect enhanced propagation on the higher bands during daylight hours, with 20m and 15m offering the best DX opportunities. The quiet geomagnetic field means minimal ionospheric disturbance, allowing for stable signal paths. Lower bands (40m/80m) will provide excellent regional and some DX coverage after sunset. Overall, it's a great day to be on the air with reliable propagation across most amateur bands.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Power Settings:** Standard power levels will work well today - no need for high power due to good conditions
- **Antenna Selection:** Directional antennas will show their advantage on 20m/15m for DX work
- **Digital Modes:** Excellent day for weak-signal digital modes like FT8 and MSK144
- **Contest Strategy:** Focus on 20m/15m during daylight, then shift to 40m/80m after sunset
- **Equipment:** Check your SWR - good conditions mean you'll want optimal antenna performance

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Early Morning (06:00-09:00 UTC):** 40m and 80m for regional contacts, 20m starting to open for DX
- **Midday (12:00-18:00 UTC):** Prime time for 20m, 17m, and 15m DX - best propagation window
- **Late Afternoon (18:00-21:00 UTC):** 20m still strong, 17m/15m beginning to fade, 40m opening up
- **Evening/Night (21:00+ UTC):** 40m and 80m dominate, excellent for regional and some DX

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m:** Excellent worldwide DX potential during daylight hours (12:00-20:00 UTC)
- **15m:** Good DX openings to Europe and Asia during peak hours (14:00-18:00 UTC)
- **17m:** Solid medium-distance DX, less crowded than 20m
- **Grayline Enhancement:** Watch for enhanced propagation 30 minutes before/after local sunrise/sunset
- **Special Conditions:** No auroral activity expected - standard F-layer propagation dominates

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.GaugePanelChart}}

- **K-index:** 1.3 (quiet geomagnetic conditions; excellent for HF propagation with minimal ionospheric disturbance)
- **Solar Flux:** 100 (moderate for HF propagation; sufficient energy for ionospheric enhancement)
- **Sunspot Number:** 133 (high activity; supports excellent HF openings and DX opportunities)
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers are down from earlier in the year but remain solid for late-cycle conditions.
- **Flares/Disturbances:** No major solar flares reported. The geomagnetic field is calming after a recent active period.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **K-index:** Currently low (K=1.3), after a spike up to K=5 yesterday.
- **Recent Trend:** Geomagnetic field was unsettled to active over the past 24 hours, but has now quieted significantly.
- **Impact:** Ionospheric recovery is underway—expect improving HF conditions, especially on the higher bands. Aurora is low, so polar paths are stabilizing.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline & Technical Details

The 24-hour propagation timeline shows the expected quality of HF propagation throughout the day. Current solar flux of 100 SFU provides adequate ionospheric ionization for reliable F-layer propagation. The quiet geomagnetic conditions (K=1.3) ensure stable ionospheric layers with minimal disturbance.

**Technical Summary:**
- **MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency):** Approximately 28-32 MHz at midday
- **Critical Frequency (foF2):** ~8-10 MHz during peak hours
- **D-Layer Absorption:** Moderate during daylight, minimal at night
- **Ionospheric Stability:** High due to quiet geomagnetic conditions
