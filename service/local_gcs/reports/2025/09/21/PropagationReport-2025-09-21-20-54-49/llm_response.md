## 📋 Propagation Summary

HF propagation is looking solid today, with very favorable solar conditions for amateur radio. The solar flux is high at 176, and sunspot numbers are robust at 157, supporting strong ionization and good upper HF band openings. The geomagnetic field is quiet, with K-index values consistently low (mostly 1–2), meaning minimal disturbances and stable propagation. Expect excellent opportunities on 20m–10m during daylight, with 40m and 80m coming alive after sunset. Now is a great time to chase DX, especially on the higher bands—get on the air and take advantage of these prime conditions!

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Daytime:** Focus on 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m for maximum reach and DX. Use verticals or directional antennas to exploit strong F-layer propagation.
- **Nighttime:** Switch to 40m and 80m for regional and intercontinental contacts; noise levels should be manageable thanks to quiet geomagnetic conditions.
- **Digital Modes:** FT8 and other weak-signal modes will excel, especially on 12m and 10m.
- **Contesting & DX:** Now is the time to work rare DX on 10m–15m; check for short-path and long-path openings.
- **Equipment:** Even modest stations will perform well today—don’t hesitate to try QRP or portable setups.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m/40m:** Best after sunset and through the night; 40m may open for DX at sunrise.
- **20m:** All-day performer, peaking mid-morning to late afternoon.
- **17m/15m:** Excellent from mid-morning through early evening.
- **12m/10m:** Open most of the daylight hours, especially late morning to late afternoon; check for sporadic E and TEP.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **DX Windows:** 10m–15m are wide open for DX, especially on east-west paths during local afternoon.
- **Grayline:** Enhanced propagation on 40m and 80m around local sunrise and sunset—perfect for chasing rare entities.
- **Special Events:** Look for enhanced north-south propagation on 10m and 12m, and possible trans-equatorial paths.
- **Aurora:** No auroral activity expected—polar paths should be stable.

**Analysis:**  
- **Best Bands:** 15m, 17m, 12m, and 10m are all in top form—expect worldwide DX, especially during daylight.
- **Nighttime:** 40m and 80m are your go-to bands for after-dark operation.
- **20m:** Remains a reliable all-day band for both local and DX contacts.
- **10m:** Watch for sudden short-skip and long-haul DX, especially in the afternoon.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.GaugePanelChart}}

- **K-index (Geomagnetic Activity):** 2 (Low)  
  - The geomagnetic field is quiet, so expect stable, undisturbed propagation.
- **Solar Flux (10.7cm):** 176 (High)  
  - Indicates strong solar energy, boosting ionization and supporting high-band openings.
- **Sunspot Number:** 157 (High)  
  - High sunspot counts mean more F-layer ionization and better DX, especially on 10m–15m.
- **Space Weather:** No significant flares or proton events reported; conditions are ideal for HF.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

- K-index has remained low (0.3–2.0) over the past 48 hours, indicating a very stable geomagnetic environment.
- No geomagnetic storms or disturbances are expected—propagation should remain reliable, especially on polar and high-latitude paths.
- Low K-index means low noise on the lower bands and minimal fading on all HF bands.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline & Technical Details

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- Expect 10m–15m to be open from mid-morning through sunset, with the best DX windows in the afternoon.
- 20m will remain active from sunrise to sunset and may stay open for intercontinental paths into the evening.
- 40m and 80m will peak after dark, with grayline enhancements at sunrise and sunset.
- No significant VHF/UHF propagation enhancements (e.g., aurora, E-skip) are expected today.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar Activity:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers are forecast to remain high, supporting continued excellent HF conditions.
- **Geomagnetic Field:** K-index is expected to stay low (1–2), so no major disturbances are anticipated.
- **HF Bands:** 10m–15m will remain open for DX; 20m stays reliable; 40m/80m will be strong at night.
- **Operator Recommendations:** Plan for daytime DX on the higher bands and night operations on 40m/80m. Great time for contests, DXpeditions, and portable/QRP work.
- **Watch For:** Possible short-lived band enhancements during grayline and minor solar upticks, but no warnings or alerts are in effect.
