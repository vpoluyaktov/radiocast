## 📋 Propagation Summary

HF propagation is looking favorable for most bands today, thanks to strong solar activity and only mildly unsettled geomagnetic conditions. Solar flux is high at 172, and sunspot numbers are robust (152), supporting excellent daytime openings on the higher bands (20m–10m). The K-index is moderate at 3, so minor geomagnetic disturbances may slightly affect polar and high-latitude paths, but most regions will see good to excellent propagation, especially on mid-to-high HF bands. Operators should take advantage of enhanced DX on 15m, 12m, and 10m during daylight, while 40m and 80m will be best after sunset. Watch for shortwave fadeouts during any solar flares, and be alert for brief auroral effects at higher latitudes.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Daytime:** Focus on 20m, 17m, 15m, 12m, and 10m for long-haul DX—these bands are wide open with high solar flux.
- **Nighttime:** Switch to 40m and 80m for strong regional and some DX contacts as higher bands close.
- **Equipment:** Use verticals or directional antennas on higher bands to maximize DX. For low bands, full-size dipoles or loops will help with night propagation.
- **Modes:** Try FT8 or CW for marginal band openings, especially on 12m and 10m.
- **Contesting/DX:** Check grayline times for enhanced propagation, especially on 40m and 80m. Monitor for sudden band changes if the K-index spikes.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m (3.5–4.0 MHz):** Best after local sunset through sunrise
- **40m (7.0–7.3 MHz):** Good at night and early morning
- **20m (14.0–14.35 MHz):** Excellent from mid-morning through late afternoon
- **17m (18.068–18.168 MHz):** Excellent late morning to early evening
- **15m (21.0–21.45 MHz):** Excellent late morning to late afternoon
- **12m (24.89–24.99 MHz):** Good mid-day to late afternoon
- **10m (28.0–29.7 MHz):** Good mid-day, especially for north-south paths

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **DX Openings:** 15m, 12m, and 10m are showing strong worldwide DX, especially along the equator and north-south paths.
- **Grayline:** Enhanced propagation on 40m and 80m during local sunrise and sunset—great for chasing rare DX.
- **Special Events:** Watch for short-lived auroral propagation at high latitudes if K-index rises above 4.
- **F2 Layer:** High solar flux means F2-layer skip is supporting intercontinental contacts on 10m and 12m.

20m, 17m, and 15m are the top performers today, offering excellent propagation from late morning through early evening. 10m and 12m are open for DX during daylight, especially on north-south paths, but will close quickly after sunset. 40m and 80m are the go-to bands for nighttime and grayline DX, with 80m peaking after dark. Expect 80m and 40m to be noisy during the day but come alive at night.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.GaugePanelChart}}

- **K-index (Geomagnetic Activity):** 3 (moderate, minor disturbances possible at high latitudes, but generally stable for HF)
- **Solar Flux (10.7cm):** 172 (very high, supports strong F-layer propagation and excellent high-band openings)
- **Sunspot Number:** 152 (robust, indicating strong solar activity and enhanced ionization)
- **Space Weather Overview:**
  - X-ray level: C1.3 (minor flare activity—watch for shortwave fadeouts)
  - Solar wind: 547.7 km/s (elevated, but not storm level)
  - Aurora: 3 (low risk for auroral disruption outside polar regions)

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

- K-index has hovered between 1 and 3 over the past 24 hours, with a recent uptick to 3.33.
- No major geomagnetic storms, but minor unsettled periods may cause brief absorption or flutter, especially on polar and trans-auroral paths.
- Expect mostly stable conditions for mid-latitude operators; high-latitude stations may notice occasional fading.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline & Technical Details

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- Daytime: 20m–10m bands are open for DX, with best conditions from late morning through mid-afternoon.
- Evening/Night: 40m and 80m open up for regional and some long-haul DX.
- Technical: High solar flux means MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency) is elevated, supporting multi-hop DX on 15m, 12m, and 10m. Watch for sudden changes if geomagnetic activity increases.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Next 3 Days:** Solar flux expected to remain high (above 160), supporting excellent high-band propagation. K-index may fluctuate between 2 and 4, so brief unsettled periods are possible but no major storms forecast.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Take advantage of 10m–15m for rare DX and contesting during daylight.
  - Monitor for shortwave fadeouts during any solar flares.
  - Nighttime: 40m and 80m will be reliable for regional and DX contacts.
  - If K-index rises above 4, expect temporary absorption and fading, especially on polar paths.
  - Keep an eye on real-time space weather updates for any sudden changes.
