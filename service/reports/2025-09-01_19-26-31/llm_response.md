## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Heads up, operators!** A geomagnetic storm is in progress today, making HF conditions tough across all bands. Expect noisy signals, fading, and generally poor propagation—especially for DX. If you’re operating, stick to lower bands at night and be patient.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 2300-0600 UTC | High noise, limited range |
| 40m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 2200-0700 UTC | Some local NVIS possible |
| 20m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1400-2000 UTC | Weak signals, short skip only |
| 17m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1500-1800 UTC | Occasional short openings |
| 15m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1600-1800 UTC | Mostly closed |
| 12m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1700-1800 UTC | Unlikely to open |
| 10m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1700-1800 UTC | Closed for most paths |

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m/40m:** Try late evening to early morning (2300-0700 UTC) for local/regional contacts.
- **20m:** Brief midday openings possible (1400-2000 UTC), but expect weak signals.
- **Higher bands (15m/12m/10m):** Largely closed—don’t expect much action today.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **DX is tough today!** Geomagnetic storms absorb HF signals, especially on higher bands.
- If you’re chasing DX, your best shot is on **40m or 20m** during their respective grayline periods (sunrise/sunset).
- Focus on **north-south paths** (e.g., North America to South America), which sometimes fare better during storms.

## 📈 3-Day Forecast

| Day      | K-Index | Conditions         |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Today    | 4.7     | Poor to Fair (Storm) |
| Tomorrow | 4.2-5.2 | Poor to Fair (Storm) |
| Day 3    | 3.7-5.7 | Poor to Fair (Storm) |

- **Summary:** Expect continued poor HF propagation for the next 2-3 days as the geomagnetic storm lingers. Watch for improvement as K-index drops below 4.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on local contacts or switch to VHF/UHF if possible.
- **DXers:** Try grayline times on 40m/20m, but keep expectations low.
- **Casual Ops:** Use digital modes (FT8, PSK31) for better weak-signal performance.
- **Noise:** Use narrow filters and noise blankers to help with storm-induced static.
- **Check the K-index:** If it drops below 4, conditions may rapidly improve—stay flexible!

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Solar Flux Index:** 100.0 (moderate; supports higher bands, but not during storms)
- **Sunspot Number:** 133 (good for potential, but storm overrides)
- **K-index:** 4.7 (geomagnetic storm—major absorption and fading)
- **A-index:** 0.0 (short-term quiet, but K-index dominates)
- **Proton Flux:** Elevated, contributing to absorption
- **HF Impact:** All bands affected, especially above 20m
- **Watch for:** Sudden improvement if geomagnetic activity calms
