## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is looking solid today thanks to high solar flux (172) and healthy sunspot numbers (150). Most bands from 20m up to 10m are open during daylight, with 40m and 80m shining at night. Geomagnetic conditions have settled after a recent disturbance, so expect improved DX and quieter noise on the low bands. Get on the air—conditions are above average for late-cycle!

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

- **Solar Flux (SF):** 172 _(radio energy from the sun; higher = better HF propagation)_
- **Sunspot Number (SSN):** 150 _(plenty of sunspots = more ionization for HF)_
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspots have rebounded after a dip in May/June. The current values support strong daytime F-layer propagation, especially on 20m–10m.
- **Flares:** No major flare activity reported.
- **Aurora:** Low (index 1), so auroral interference is minimal.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m | 🔴 Poor | 🔵 Good | 2200-0600 UTC | Low noise after sunset |
| 40m | 🔴 Poor | 🟢 Excellent | 2100-0700 UTC | Best DX band at night |
| 20m | 🟢 Excellent | 🔵 Good | 1000-2200 UTC | Reliable all day |
| 17m | 🔵 Good | 🟡 Fair | 1200-2000 UTC | Good for EU/NA |
| 15m | 🔵 Good | 🔴 Poor | 1400-1800 UTC | Solar dependent |
| 12m | 🟡 Fair | ⚫ Closed | 1500-1700 UTC | Sporadic openings |
| 10m | 🟡 Fair | ⚫ Closed | 1600-1700 UTC | Solar cycle dependent |

- **80m/40m:** Nighttime is your friend—low noise, great for regional and some DX.
- **20m:** The workhorse—open sunrise to sunset, solid for DX and casual QSO.
- **17m/15m:** Good midday, especially for intercontinental paths.
- **12m/10m:** Watch for brief afternoon openings, especially during solar peaks.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **K-index:** Currently low (K=0–2), indicating a quiet geomagnetic field.
- **Recent Trend:** After a period of unsettled to minor storm conditions (K=4–5) two days ago, the geomagnetic field has calmed significantly.
- **Impact:** Low K means less absorption and noise, especially on the low bands (80m/40m). Good for polar and high-latitude DX paths.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m/40m:** 2200–0700 UTC (nighttime—quiet, long skip possible)
- **20m:** 1000–2200 UTC (daytime—excellent for DX and ragchew)
- **17m/15m:** 1200–1800 UTC (midday—best for transatlantic and transpacific)
- **12m/10m:** 1500–1700 UTC (watch for short-lived openings, especially to South America and Africa)

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best Bands for DX:** 20m and 17m are the most reliable for long-haul contacts today.
- **Open Paths:** East-west (Europe <-> Americas, Americas <-> Asia) are strong on 20m/17m. Some north-south (Americas <-> South America/Africa) on 15m/12m during peak solar hours.
- **Polar Paths:** Quiet geomagnetic field means polar openings are possible—try 20m/17m for Scandinavia, Russia, or VK/ZL.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

- **Solar Activity:** Solar flux and sunspots expected to remain high (SF 160–175, SSN 130–150).
- **Geomagnetic Field:** Quiet to unsettled (K=1–3), no major storms forecast.
- **HF Bands:** 20m–15m will stay strong during the day; 40m/80m will be excellent at night.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{PROPAGATION_TIMELINE_CHART}}

- **0000–0600 UTC:** 40m/80m prime time, low noise, good for DX and nets.
- **0600–1200 UTC:** 20m opens at sunrise; 17m/15m follow.
- **1200–1800 UTC:** All upper bands (20m–10m) at their best; check 10m for surprise openings.
- **1800–2200 UTC:** 20m/17m still open, 40m/80m start to improve as sun sets.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during the day for maximum rate; 40m at night for multipliers.
- **DXers:** Try 17m/15m midday for less crowded pileups and rare DX. Watch for grayline enhancements on 40m/80m at sunrise/sunset.
- **Casual Ops:** 20m is your best bet for reliable contacts all day. Use 40m/80m after dark for local and regional QSOs.
- **VHF/UHF:** No major enhancements, but check local beacons for surprises.
