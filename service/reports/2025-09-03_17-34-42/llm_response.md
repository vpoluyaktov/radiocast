## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is rebounding after a recent geomagnetic storm, with solar flux and sunspot numbers supporting good daytime openings on 20m–10m. The K-index has dropped back to quiet levels, so expect improving conditions, especially on the higher bands. Nighttime low bands (40m, 80m) are performing well—get on the air for some great DX opportunities!

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

- **Solar Flux (SF):** 180 (very good for HF, especially 10m–15m)
- **Sunspot Number (SSN):** 128 (solid, supports strong F-layer ionization)
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspots have bounced back after a summer dip, now trending higher again.
- **Flares:** No major flare activity reported. Proton and electron fluxes are elevated but not at storm levels.

**What this means:** The sun is active enough to support reliable long-distance HF propagation, especially during the day on higher bands.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m | 🔴 Poor | 🔵 Good | 2200-0600 UTC | Low noise after sunset |
| 40m | 🟡 Fair | 🟢 Excellent | 2100-0700 UTC | Best DX band at night |
| 20m | 🟢 Excellent | 🔵 Good | 1000-2200 UTC | Reliable all day |
| 17m | 🔵 Good | 🟡 Fair | 1200-2000 UTC | Good for EU/NA |
| 15m | 🔵 Good | 🔴 Poor | 1400-1800 UTC | Solar dependent |
| 12m | 🟡 Fair | ⚫ Closed | 1500-1700 UTC | Sporadic openings |
| 10m | 🟡 Fair | ⚫ Closed | 1600-1700 UTC | Solar cycle dependent |

- **Best bands right now:** 20m, 17m, 15m (daytime); 40m, 80m (night)
- **Watch for:** Short, strong 10m/12m openings in the afternoon, especially for north-south paths

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **K-index:** Dropped from storm levels (K=6) yesterday to quiet (K=1–2) today
- **A-index:** 12 (moderate, but trending down)
- **Recent Trend:** Stormy conditions from a recent CME have passed; the geomagnetic field is settling.
- **Impact:** HF blackouts and auroral absorption have ended. Expect rapid improvement on all bands, especially higher HF.

**Takeaway:** Conditions are stabilizing—now is the time to check the higher bands for reopening!

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Morning (1000–1400 UTC):** 20m and 17m open early, good for Asia/Pacific DX
- **Afternoon (1400–2000 UTC):** 15m, 12m, and 10m open for short/medium skip, especially for north-south paths
- **Evening (2000–0000 UTC):** 20m stays open late, 40m/80m start to shine for DX
- **Night (0000–0600 UTC):** 40m and 80m are best for long-haul DX and low noise

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m:** Excellent for worldwide DX during daylight, especially east-west (Europe, Americas, Asia)
- **17m/15m:** Good for intercontinental paths midday; check for short openings to Africa and South America
- **10m/12m:** Watch for brief, strong openings—especially north-south (South America, Africa, Oceania)
- **40m/80m:** Prime for DX at night, especially to opposite hemispheres

**Tip:** After a geomagnetic storm, higher bands can surprise you—tune around for rare openings!

---

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

- **Day 1:** Quiet geomagnetic conditions, improving HF. Expect good 20m–15m openings, especially midday.
- **Day 2:** Stable solar activity, continued good propagation. 10m/12m may open for short periods.
- **Day 3:** No major disturbances expected. Low bands stay strong at night, high bands best during daylight.

**Summary:** Each day should bring slightly better conditions as the ionosphere recovers from the recent storm.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{PROPAGATION_TIMELINE_CHART}}

- **Daylight:** 20m–15m open, with 10m/12m possible for brief windows
- **Dusk:** 20m fades, 40m/80m ramp up for nighttime DX
- **Night:** 40m/80m are the go-to bands; 20m may stay open late, especially on north-south paths

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during the day; 40m and 80m at night for multipliers
- **DXers:** Check 10m/12m for surprise openings, especially after geomagnetic storms
- **Casual Ops:** 20m is your “easy button” for reliable contacts all day
- **Digital Modes:** FT8/FT4 can exploit weak openings on 12m/10m—watch the waterfall!
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancement expected; stick to local FM and repeaters
