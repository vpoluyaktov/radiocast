## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is generally **good** today, with stable geomagnetic conditions (K=1) and moderate solar activity (solar flux 133, sunspots 83). Expect the best results on 20m, 17m, and 15m during the day, with 40m and 80m coming alive after sunset. Higher bands (12m/10m) are less reliable but may open for short periods.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.SunGif}}

Solar flux is at **133** (a measure of solar radio energy, higher means better HF propagation), and sunspot numbers are at **83**—both moderate and supportive of decent HF conditions. No major solar flares or disturbances reported. Over the past few months, solar activity has dipped from earlier peaks but remains strong enough for good DX on most bands.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band   | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Operating Times       | Notes                                                                 |
|--------|:-------------:|:---------------:|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 80m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, early morning      | Quiet geomagnetic field helps; best for local/regional NVIS at night. |
| 40m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, sunrise/sunset     | Good for domestic and some DX after dark; less noise than usual.      |
| 20m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to early eve | Reliable for DX, open most daylight hours; some night openings.       |
| 17m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to afternoon | Good for intercontinental DX; less crowded than 20m.                  |
| 15m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Midday to late afternoon  | Short/medium skip possible; check for sporadic E.                     |
| 12m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon           | Unreliable, but watch for brief openings during peak solar hours.     |
| 10m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon           | Mostly closed, but check for short-lived openings, especially S/N.    |

**Analysis:**  
- **Best daytime bands:** 20m, 17m, 15m (🟡 Good) — expect reliable DX and regional contacts.
- **Best nighttime bands:** 40m, 80m (🟡 Good after sunset) — low noise, good for domestic and some DX.
- **12m/10m:** Only brief, spotty openings possible; monitor for surprise short-path DX.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

The K-index has dropped back to **quiet levels (K=1)** after a brief unsettled period yesterday (K reached 5). The geomagnetic field is now stable, which favors HF propagation and reduces auroral absorption, especially at higher latitudes. Expect minimal geomagnetic disruption today.

---

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **20m/17m/15m:** 1400–2100 UTC for DX and long-haul contacts.
- **40m/80m:** 0000–0800 UTC for domestic and some international work.
- **10m/12m:** 1600–2000 UTC—check for short, sporadic openings, especially toward the equator and southern paths.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m and 17m** are your best bets for worldwide DX, especially on east-west paths during daylight.
- **15m** may support intercontinental DX during midday, especially with low K-index.
- **40m** opens for transcontinental and some intercontinental DX after sunset.
- **Watch for grayline openings** (sunrise/sunset) on 40m and 20m for enhanced long-path DX.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar activity:** Expected to remain moderate, with solar flux steady around 130–135.
- **Geomagnetic field:** Quiet to unsettled (K=1–2), no major storms forecast.
- **HF bands:** 20m/17m/15m will continue to perform well; 10m/12m may improve if solar flux ticks up.
- **No alerts or warnings** for major disruptions—enjoy stable conditions!

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- **Daytime:** 20m/17m/15m open wide, especially late morning through afternoon.
- **Evening/Night:** 40m and 80m become the go-to bands, with low noise and good reach.
- **10m/12m:** Watch for brief, unpredictable openings in early afternoon.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m, 17m, and 15m during the day for high rates; move to 40m/80m at night.
- **DXers:** Check 20m and 17m during grayline for rare DX; monitor 10m/12m for surprise openings.
- **Casual ops:** Try 17m for less crowded, easy DX; 40m/80m for local nets and ragchews after dark.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected; normal conditions.
