## 🎯 Quick Summary

High solar activity today with a solar flux of 187 and sunspot numbers at 175, but elevated geomagnetic activity (K-index 4–5) is causing poor to fair HF conditions. Expect noisy bands, especially below 20m, with best chances for contacts on 15m and 17m during daylight. Watch for possible aurora on VHF/UHF and check for brief high-band openings.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

Solar activity remains strong:
- **Solar Flux (10.7 cm radio energy):** 187 (very high, supports higher band openings)
- **Sunspot Number:** 175 (active sun, good for propagation when geomagnetic conditions are quiet)
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspots have stayed high for months, but the last two months show a slight dip in flux even as sunspots remain robust.
- **Flares:** No major flare alerts, but active regions are present.

High solar flux means the ionosphere is well-charged, but geomagnetic disturbances are limiting the benefits.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔵 Good         | 2200-0600 UTC | High noise, better after sunset |
| 40m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🟢 Excellent    | 2100-0700 UTC | Best for local/regional at night |
| 20m  | 🟡 Fair       | 🟡 Fair         | 1000-2200 UTC | Struggles with geomagnetic noise |
| 17m  | 🔵 Good       | 🟡 Fair         | 1200-2000 UTC | Daytime DX possible |
| 15m  | 🔵 Good       | 🔴 Poor         | 1400-1800 UTC | Short openings, check often |
| 12m  | 🟡 Fair       | ⚫ Closed        | 1500-1700 UTC | Sporadic, watch for brief DX |
| 10m  | 🟡 Fair       | ⚫ Closed        | 1600-1700 UTC | Occasional openings, solar dependent |

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **Current K-index:** 4–5 (elevated, minor geomagnetic storm levels)
- **Recent Trend:** K-index has fluctuated between 2 and 5 in the last 24 hours, with several spikes above 4.
- **Impact:** Increased absorption and fading, especially on lower HF bands. Expect auroral activity at higher latitudes and possible blackout periods on 80m/40m.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Morning (1000–1400 UTC):** 20m and 17m open for east-west paths, some 15m activity possible.
- **Afternoon (1400–1800 UTC):** 15m and 17m best for DX; 12m/10m may briefly open.
- **Evening/Night (2100–0700 UTC):** 40m and 80m improve for local/regional; 20m closes early due to geomagnetic absorption.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best Bands:** 17m and 15m during daylight, especially for transatlantic and transpacific paths.
- **Short-Path DX:** Focus on 15m/17m to Europe, Africa, and South America from North America in the afternoon.
- **Long-Path DX:** Limited due to geomagnetic activity; try 20m at sunrise/sunset for possible surprises.
- **Aurora Watch:** VHF/UHF operators in northern latitudes—check 6m and 2m for auroral propagation.

---

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

- **Solar Activity:** Remains high, with solar flux staying above 180 and sunspot numbers strong.
- **Geomagnetic Activity:** K-index likely to stay elevated (3–5), with possible minor storm periods.
- **HF Outlook:** Expect continued absorption and fading, especially on lower bands. Higher bands (15m/17m) may offer brief DX windows during daylight.
- **VHF/UHF:** Watch for auroral openings if K-index spikes above 5.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{PROPAGATION_TIMELINE_CHART}}

- **00–06 UTC:** 40m/80m best for local/regional, noisy but usable.
- **06–12 UTC:** 20m/17m open for east-west, 15m possible.
- **12–18 UTC:** 15m/17m peak for DX, 12m/10m may open briefly.
- **18–24 UTC:** 20m closes early, 40m/80m improve after sunset.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 17m and 15m during daylight for maximum QSO rates; check 20m in the morning.
- **DXers:** Watch for short, strong openings on 15m/17m—be ready to pounce!
- **Casual Operators:** Try 40m after sunset for reliable contacts; expect noise on lower bands.
- **VHF/UHF:** Monitor for auroral propagation if you’re in northern latitudes—K-index is high enough for possible events.
- **All Ops:** Use narrow filters and strong noise reduction to combat band noise.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Solar Flux:** 187 (supports high-band propagation)
- **Sunspot Number:** 175 (very active)
- **A-index:** 44 (disturbed)
- **K-index:** 4–5 (minor storm, absorption likely)
- **Proton Flux:** 5270, **Electron Flux:** 6200 (elevated, can affect polar paths)
- **Recent Sunspot Trend:** Monthly SSN has stayed above 120 for most of 2025, peaking near 175.
- **Solar Flux Trend:** Peaked above 180 in early 2025, now around 100–187.

**Summary:** High solar activity is fueling the ionosphere, but geomagnetic storms are limiting HF performance. Watch for brief high-band openings and possible auroral VHF/UHF events. Lower bands will be noisy—plan accordingly!
