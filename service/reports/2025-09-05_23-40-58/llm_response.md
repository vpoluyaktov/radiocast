## 🎯 Quick Summary

Today’s HF propagation is looking 🟡 good on most bands, with solar flux at 149 and sunspot numbers holding steady. Expect solid daytime performance on 20m–15m, while 10m is only 🟠 fair. Geomagnetic activity is moderate but trending upward—keep an eye out for possible short-term disturbances, especially later today and into tomorrow.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{SUN_GIF}}

Solar flux (the sun’s radio energy) is at **149**, which is a healthy level for HF propagation. Today’s sunspot number is **128**, indicating the sun is still quite active, supporting higher MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency) and good band openings. No major solar flares have been reported, so no sudden blackouts are expected.

Recent months show a dip in both solar flux and sunspot numbers compared to the peak earlier this year, but current values remain favorable for HF.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

{{BAND_TABLE}}

- **80m–40m:** 🟠 Poor during the day, 🟡 fair at night. Expect high noise and limited range daytime; local and regional contacts improve after sunset.
- **30m–20m:** 🟡 Good day & night. These are your best all-around bands right now for both DX and domestic QSOs.
- **17m–15m:** 🟡 Good day & night. Expect reliable openings, especially midday and early afternoon.
- **12m–10m:** 🟠 Fair during the day, 🔴 poor at night. 10m may open for short periods, especially for east-west paths, but don’t expect much after dark.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{K_INDEX_CHART}}

The K-index has hovered between 1 and 3 most of the past 24 hours, but has risen to **K=4** recently, indicating increased geomagnetic activity. This can cause short-term fading and auroral effects, especially at higher latitudes and on polar paths. If the K-index stays elevated, expect some 🟠 fair to 🔴 poor conditions on the higher bands and possible auroral propagation on VHF.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **20m/17m/15m:** Late morning through early evening (local time) for both domestic and DX.
- **40m/80m:** After sunset and through the night for regional and some DX, especially as D-layer absorption drops.
- **10m/12m:** Try late morning to early afternoon, especially if you’re chasing sporadic E or F2 openings.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best DX bands:** 20m and 17m are your go-to for long-haul contacts today, with 15m also showing promise.
- **10m/12m:** Watch for short-lived openings, especially on east-west paths or during brief MUF spikes.
- **Grayline:** Sunrise and sunset are prime times for enhanced DX, especially on 40m and 20m.
- **Polar/East-West Paths:** Increased K-index may favor auroral propagation for VHF, but may hinder polar HF paths.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{FORECAST_CHART}}

- **Solar flux** expected to remain in the 140–150 range—good for HF.
- **Sunspot numbers** stable, supporting continued band openings.
- **Geomagnetic activity** may remain elevated (K=3–4), so watch for short-term disturbances, especially at night and on higher bands.
- **HF:** 20m–15m will continue to be the most reliable; 10m will be hit-or-miss.
- **VHF:** Possible auroral enhancement if K-index stays high.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{PROPAGATION_TIMELINE_CHART}}

- **Midday:** 20m–15m wide open, 10m/12m possible for short periods.
- **Afternoon:** 20m/17m/15m remain strong; 10m/12m fade.
- **Evening/Night:** 40m/80m improve for local and some DX; higher bands close.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m–15m during the day for rate; 40m after dark for multipliers.
- **DXers:** Watch grayline on 20m and 17m for best long-haul paths; check 10m for surprise openings.
- **Casual ops:** 20m is your “anytime” band; 40m/80m for local nets after sunset.
- **VHF:** Monitor for auroral activity if K-index stays high—try 6m and 2m for rare modes.
- **Digital modes:** FT8 and other weak-signal modes will help you squeeze out contacts on marginal bands.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Solar Flux:** 149
- **Sunspot Number:** 128 (current), monthly average 133.5 (August)
- **K-index:** 3–4 (rising)
- **A-index:** 8 (quiet to unsettled)
- **Recent trend:** Solar activity slightly down from earlier in the year, but still supporting good HF conditions.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or Es enhancement reported, but auroral propagation possible if geomagnetic activity increases.
