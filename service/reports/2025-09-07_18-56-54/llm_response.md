## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is in good shape today thanks to moderate solar flux (133) and low geomagnetic activity (K=2). Expect solid openings on 20m and 17m, with 15m also showing promise. Higher bands (12m/10m) are fair during the day but fade at night. Low bands (80m/40m) will shine after sunset—get on the air for reliable contacts!

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.SunGif}}

- **Solar Flux (10.7 cm radio energy):** 133 – This is a healthy value, supporting good ionization for HF propagation.
- **Sunspot Number:** 83 (current), with recent monthly averages in the 120–130s. This keeps the ionosphere energized for most bands.
- **Solar Flares:** No significant flare activity reported; stable conditions.
- **Space Weather Overview:** The sun is moderately active, with no major disturbances. The last few months have seen a slight dip in sunspot numbers but still well above solar minimum levels.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band  | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Operating Times | Notes |
|-------|:-------------:|:---------------:|---------------------|-------|
| 80m   | 🟠 Fair       | 🟢 Excellent    | Night, pre-sunrise  | Quiet geomagnetic field means low noise and strong local/regional contacts at night. Daytime D-layer absorption limits range. |
| 40m   | 🟡 Good       | 🟢 Excellent    | Night, early morning| Great for both local and DX after dark. Daytime is decent for regional work. |
| 30m   | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | All day/night       | Consistent performer; good for digital and CW. Some daytime absorption but reliable. |
| 20m   | 🟢 Excellent  | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to sunset | Main DX band today—open worldwide during daylight, some evening paths linger. |
| 17m   | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to afternoon | Good for DX, especially midday. Nighttime paths possible but weaker. |
| 15m   | 🟡 Good       | 🟠 Fair         | Midday to late afternoon | Open for transcontinental and some DX, especially N-S. Weakens after sunset. |
| 12m   | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Local noon, early afternoon | Spotty openings—watch for short DX windows. Mostly closed at night. |
| 10m   | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Noon, early afternoon | Occasional short openings, especially N-S. Sporadic-E possible but not reliable. |

**Analysis:**  
- **Best Bands:** 20m is the star performer for worldwide DX. 17m and 15m are also productive, especially for N-S paths and during midday.
- **Challenging Bands:** 12m and 10m are unreliable except for brief daytime openings—check for sporadic-E or F2 surprises.
- **Low Bands:** 80m and 40m are excellent after dark for both local and long-haul contacts.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **Current K-index:** 2 (quiet)
- **Recent Trend:** K-index briefly spiked to 5 (active) yesterday, but has since calmed and remained low for the past 18 hours.
- **Impact:** Low geomagnetic activity means stable propagation, especially on the low bands. No auroral disturbances expected.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m/40m:** After sunset through sunrise—lowest noise, best for local and regional nets, and some DX.
- **20m/17m/15m:** Late morning through late afternoon—prime time for DX and intercontinental contacts.
- **10m/12m:** Try around local noon for any brief openings, especially for N-S paths or sporadic-E.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m:** Wide open for global DX, especially E-W paths during daylight.
- **17m/15m:** Good for DX, especially to South America, Africa, and the Pacific during midday.
- **Low Bands (80m/40m):** Look for grayline DX at sunrise/sunset.
- **10m/12m:** Watch for short, surprise openings—beacons and FT8 can help spot them.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar Flux:** Expected to remain stable (130–135), supporting continued good HF propagation.
- **Geomagnetic Activity:** No major storms forecast; K-index likely to stay low (1–2).
- **Propagation Outlook:**  
  - 20m/17m/15m will remain strong during the day.
  - 10m/12m may see brief, weak openings—monitor for sporadic-E.
  - 80m/40m will continue to be excellent at night.
- **Advice:** No alerts—enjoy stable conditions. Watch for any sudden solar events, but none are expected.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- **Daytime:** 20m, 17m, and 15m are your go-to bands for DX and continent-hopping.
- **Evening/Night:** Switch to 40m and 80m for strong signals and lower noise.
- **Around Noon:** Check 10m/12m for any brief F2 or sporadic-E openings.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during the day for high rates; move to 40m/80m after sunset.
- **DXers:** Use grayline times on 40m/80m for rare long-haul contacts. 20m is your best bet for all-day DX.
- **Casual Operators:** Try 17m for less crowded, high-quality QSOs. Digital modes (FT8, PSK) can squeeze out contacts on marginal bands.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected—local and repeater work only.
