## 🎯 Quick Summary

Propagation is **challenging today** with most HF bands underperforming despite quiet geomagnetic conditions and moderate solar activity. Expect limited openings on higher bands; 40m and 20m may offer some opportunities, especially during peak daylight and early evening hours.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 2300-0500 UTC | High noise, weak signals |
| 40m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 2200-0600 UTC | Limited regional NVIS, weak DX |
| 20m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1400-2000 UTC | Occasional short openings |
| 17m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1500-1800 UTC | Brief, weak signals possible |
| 15m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1600-1800 UTC | Watch for sporadic openings |
| 12m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1700-1800 UTC | Unlikely to open |
| 10m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1700-1800 UTC | Mostly closed |

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Late afternoon (1400-2000 UTC):** 20m may briefly support short-haul contacts.
- **Evenings (2200-0600 UTC):** 40m and 80m for local/regional QSOs, but expect high noise and weak signals.
- **Monitor for sudden short-lived openings** on 15m and 17m during daylight.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **DX is limited today.**  
  - If you're chasing DX, try 20m during your local afternoon for possible weak transcontinental paths (east-west favored).
  - 40m may support some low-latitude DX around sunrise/sunset, but signals will be weak.

## 📈 3-Day Forecast

| Day      | K-Index | Expected Conditions      |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|
| Today    | 1.7     | Poor to Fair, mostly poor |
| Tomorrow | 1.2-2.2 | Poor to Fair, slight improvement possible |
| Day 3    | 0.7-2.7 | Poor to Fair, stable but weak |

- **Solar activity is moderate** (SFI ~100, sunspots 133), but not enough to boost higher bands.
- **Geomagnetic field remains quiet**, so no major disruptions expected.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **For contests:** Focus on 40m and 20m during their brief best periods; use digital modes (FT8, FT4) to maximize weak signal contacts.
- **For DXers:** Watch for grayline openings on 20m and 40m; be patient and persistent.
- **For casual ops:** Try local nets on 80m/40m in the evening, but expect higher noise and weaker signals.
- **Digital modes** will outperform SSB/CW under these conditions—give them a try!

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Solar Flux Index (SFI):** 100.0 (moderate, but not enough for strong F-layer support)
- **Sunspot Number:** 133 (decent, but not translating to good propagation)
- **K-index:** 1.7 (quiet geomagnetic field, so no storm-related disruptions)
- **A-index:** 0.0 (very quiet)
- **Proton Flux:** 6.42e+04 particles/cm²/s (normal background)
- **MUF (Maximum Usable Frequency):** Lower than average; expect 10-15 MHz max for most paths
- **Trend:** Stable, but weak HF conditions
