## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF conditions are improving after recent geomagnetic storms. With high solar flux (172) and a healthy sunspot count (150), expect good daytime openings on 20m–10m, especially for DX. Nighttime low bands (40m/80m) will be quieter and reliable—get on the air for some solid contacts!

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

- **Solar Flux (F10.7):** 172 (very strong, means more energy in the ionosphere)
- **Sunspot Number:** 150 (well above average, supports higher band openings)
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspots have rebounded after a dip in May/June, now supporting robust HF propagation.
- **Flares:** No major flare activity reported, so no sudden blackouts expected.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔵 Good         | 2200-0600 UTC | Low noise after sunset |
| 40m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🟢 Excellent    | 2100-0700 UTC | Best DX band at night |
| 20m  | 🟢 Excellent  | 🔵 Good         | 1000-2200 UTC | Reliable all day |
| 17m  | 🔵 Good       | 🟡 Fair         | 1200-2000 UTC | Good for EU/NA |
| 15m  | 🔵 Good       | 🔴 Poor         | 1400-1800 UTC | Solar dependent |
| 12m  | 🟡 Fair       | ⚫ Closed        | 1500-1700 UTC | Sporadic openings |
| 10m  | 🟡 Fair       | ⚫ Closed        | 1600-1700 UTC | Solar cycle dependent |

- **Best Bands Now:** 20m, 17m, 15m (day); 40m, 80m (night)
- **Watch for:** Short 10m/12m openings in the afternoon, especially for north-south paths

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **Current K-index:** 2 (quiet)
- **Recent Trend:** K-index was stormy (K=5–6) two days ago but has settled to quiet (K=1–3) over the last 24 hours.
- **Impact:** HF propagation is recovering—expect less fading and noise, especially on low bands. Aurora is low (3), so minimal auroral disturbance.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Morning (1000–1400 UTC):** 20m and 17m open for east-west DX; 15m starts to open.
- **Afternoon (1400–1800 UTC):** 15m, 12m, and 10m may open for north-south DX (South America, Africa, Oceania).
- **Evening (2000–0600 UTC):** 40m and 80m come alive for regional and some DX; noise drops after sunset.
- **Late Night (0600–1000 UTC):** 40m remains strong for long-haul DX, especially to the Pacific.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m:** Wide open for intercontinental DX most of the day—try long path in the morning, short path in the afternoon.
- **17m/15m:** Good for Europe, North America, and South America in the early afternoon.
- **10m/12m:** Watch for brief, sporadic E or F2 openings—check beacons and FT8 for activity.
- **40m:** Excellent for DX at night, especially after midnight UTC.
- **Geographic Patterns:** North-south paths (e.g., EU–Africa, NA–SA) are favored on higher bands; east-west (e.g., NA–EU, EU–VK) best on 20m/17m.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

- **Solar Activity:** Solar flux and sunspots should remain high, supporting good HF propagation.
- **Geomagnetic Field:** Expected to stay quiet (K=1–3), so low noise and stable conditions.
- **HF Bands:** 20m–15m will be reliable during the day; 40m/80m strong at night.
- **VHF:** No major tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected.
- **Alerts:** No significant solar storms or radio blackouts forecast.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{PROPAGATION_TIMELINE_CHART}}

- **Day:** 20m–15m best for DX, 10m/12m possible short openings.
- **Night:** 40m/80m best for regional and some DX, especially after local sunset.
- **Greyline:** Sunrise/sunset periods offer enhanced long-path DX on 40m/20m.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during daylight; 40m at night for multipliers.
- **DXers:** Check 17m/15m for new countries in the afternoon; monitor 10m for surprise openings.
- **Casual Ops:** Try 20m mid-morning to early evening for reliable QSOs worldwide.
- **Digital Modes:** FT8/FT4 will help spot fleeting 10m/12m openings—watch PSKReporter for activity spikes.
- **Low Power (QRP):** Take advantage of quiet geomagnetic conditions—less noise means better chances on 40m/20m.
