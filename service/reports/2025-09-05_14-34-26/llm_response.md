## 🎯 Quick Summary

Conditions are looking good for HF operators today! Solar activity is moderate with a solar flux of 149 and sunspot numbers holding steady, supporting reliable openings on 20m–15m during the day. Geomagnetic activity has calmed after a recent spike, so expect improved band stability and some solid DX opportunities, especially during daylight hours.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

- **Solar Flux (radio energy from the sun):** 149 (moderate, supports good HF propagation)
- **Sunspot Number:** 128 (healthy, means more ionization for better band openings)
- **Recent Trend:** Sunspot numbers and solar flux have rebounded from a dip in May–June, now stabilizing at levels that favor higher band openings.
- **Solar Flares:** No major flare activity reported; quiet conditions.
- **Other Solar Data:** Helium line and proton/electron fluxes are within normal ranges.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

Daytime and nighttime conditions vary across the bands. Here’s what to expect:

{{BAND_CONDITIONS_CHART}}

{{BAND_TABLE}}

- **80m–40m:** 🟠 Fair during the day, 🟡 Good at night. Expect some daytime absorption, but solid local/regional contacts after sunset.
- **30m–20m:** 🟡 Good both day and night. These are your workhorse bands right now for both DX and domestic QSOs.
- **17m–15m:** 🟡 Good all day and into the evening. Great for DX, especially on east-west paths.
- **12m–10m:** 🟠 Fair during the day, 🔴 Poor at night. 10m may open for short periods, especially around local noon, but expect patchy conditions.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **K-index:** Currently at 2 (quiet). The past 24 hours saw a return to stable conditions after a brief period of elevated activity (Kp 4–5).
- **A-index:** 11 (low to moderate, minimal impact).
- **Impact:** The quiet geomagnetic field means less absorption and fading, especially at higher latitudes. Aurora is low, so no major VHF auroral propagation expected.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Morning (local):** 20m and 17m open early, good for eastward DX.
- **Midday:** 15m and 12m have their best chance for openings; check 10m for brief sporadic-E or F2 hops.
- **Afternoon/Evening:** 20m and 17m remain strong; 40m improves for regional and some DX as the sun sets.
- **Night:** 40m and 80m are the go-to bands for stable, longer contacts.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best DX Bands:** 20m, 17m, and 15m are your best bets for long-haul contacts today.
- **Best Times:** Late morning through early evening for transcontinental and intercontinental paths.
- **Geographic Patterns:**
  - **East-West:** Strongest on 17m/15m during daylight.
  - **North-South:** 20m and 17m favor polar and equatorial paths, especially during grayline (dawn/dusk).
- **10m:** Watch for short, sporadic openings—especially if you hear beacons or strong FT8 signals.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

- **Solar Activity:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers are expected to remain steady, supporting continued good conditions on the higher bands.
- **Geomagnetic Field:** No major storms forecast; K-index should stay below 3.
- **Propagation Outlook:** Expect similar conditions for the next few days—good daytime openings on 20m–15m, with nighttime favoring 40m/80m.

- **06–12 UTC:** 20m opens up, especially for eastward DX.
- **12–18 UTC:** 17m and 15m peak; check 10m for brief openings.
- **18–24 UTC:** 20m and 17m remain open; 40m improves as the sun sets.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m–15m during the day for rate; move to 40m/80m after dark.
- **DXers:** Watch for grayline openings on 20m and 17m for rare country hunting.
- **Casual Operators:** Try 20m for reliable QSOs all day; experiment with 15m for surprise DX.
- **Digital Modes:** FT8 and other weak-signal modes can squeeze out contacts even on marginal 12m/10m openings.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected—stick to local FM or repeaters.
