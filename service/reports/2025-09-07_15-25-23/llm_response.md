## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF conditions are generally favorable today, with low geomagnetic activity and moderate solar flux supporting good propagation on most bands. Expect the best performance on 20m–17m during the day, with 40m and 80m shining at night. Higher bands (12m–10m) are fair but may open for short periods, especially in the afternoon.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.SunGif}}

- **Solar Flux (10.7 cm):** 133 — this is a moderate value, supporting decent HF propagation.
- **Sunspot Number:** 83 — a healthy count, indicating active solar regions to help ionize the bands.
- **Recent Trend:** After a dip in May, both solar flux and sunspot numbers have rebounded and stabilized, keeping conditions above average for this phase of the solar cycle.
- **Flares/Disturbances:** No significant solar flares or proton events reported.
- **Summary:** The sun is providing enough energy for reliable HF operation, especially on the mid and lower bands.

| 80m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, early morning     | Quiet geomagnetic field aids low noise; great for local/regional NVIS |
| 40m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, sunrise/sunset    | Good for domestic and some DX at night; less static than 80m          |
| 30m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | All day & night          | Very stable, low noise, supports DX round the clock                   |
| 20m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to sunset   | Main DX band; open most of the day, some night paths possible         |
| 17m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to late afternoon | Good for DX, less crowded than 20m, opens with solar flux >120    |
| 15m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟠 Fair         | Midday to late afternoon | Open for DX, especially N/S paths; closes after sunset                |
| 12m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon          | Marginal, brief openings possible on strong paths                     |
| 10m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon          | Sporadic short openings; check for beacons and FT8 activity           |

**Analysis:**  
- **Best Bands:** 20m, 17m, and 15m are your best bets for reliable daytime DX and intercontinental contacts.
- **Nighttime:** 40m and 80m come alive after sunset, ideal for regional and some long-haul contacts.
- **Challenging Bands:** 12m and 10m are hit-or-miss; monitor for brief openings, especially for north-south paths or during peak solar hours.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

- **Current K-index:** 1 (very quiet)
- **Last 24h Trend:** After a brief unsettled period (K=4–5), the geomagnetic field has calmed dramatically.
- **Impact:** Low K-index means low absorption and minimal auroral disturbance, so HF propagation is stable and noise is low, especially on the lower bands.

---

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **20m/17m/15m:** 10:00–18:00 local time — best for DX and international contacts.
- **40m/80m:** 1 hour before sunset through sunrise — best for domestic and regional QSOs, with some DX possible on 40m.
- **10m/12m:** 12:00–16:00 local time — check for short, sporadic openings, especially on FT8 or CW.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **20m and 17m:** Most reliable for long-haul DX, especially on east-west paths during daylight.
- **15m:** Good for north-south DX (e.g., South America, Africa, Oceania) during midday.
- **30m:** Steady for overnight DX, especially for digital modes.
- **10m/12m:** Watch for brief, surprise openings — monitor beacons and digital clusters.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar Flux:** Expected to remain in the 130–135 range, supporting continued good HF conditions.
- **Geomagnetic Activity:** K-index forecast to stay low (K=1–2), so no major disruptions expected.
- **Propagation Outlook:**  
  - **Daytime:** 20m–15m will remain open for DX, with 17m and 15m improving if solar flux ticks up.
  - **Nighttime:** 40m and 80m will continue to be strong for domestic and some international contacts.
  - **10m/12m:** Still marginal, but watch for enhanced conditions if solar activity increases.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- **Morning:** 40m/30m open for regional and some DX; 20m starts to open.
- **Midday:** 20m/17m/15m at their peak for DX; 10m/12m may briefly open.
- **Afternoon:** 15m/17m/20m remain strong; 10m/12m may close early.
- **Evening/Night:** 40m/80m take over for regional and some long-haul QSOs.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m/15m during daylight for rate; switch to 40m/80m after dark.
- **DXers:** Monitor 17m and 15m for less crowded, high-quality DX. Use FT8 or CW to take advantage of marginal band openings.
- **Casual Ops:** Try 30m for all-day, low-noise contacts. Great for digital modes and ragchews.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected; normal line-of-sight conditions prevail.
- **Beacons & Clusters:** Use them to spot surprise 10m/12m openings.
