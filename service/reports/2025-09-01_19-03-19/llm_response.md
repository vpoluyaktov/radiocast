## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Heads up, HAMs!** Geomagnetic activity is high today (K-index 4.0), making HF conditions challenging across all bands. Expect poor propagation, especially on higher frequencies. If you’re operating, stick to lower bands after dark and watch for brief openings as conditions settle.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 80m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 2300-0500 UTC | High noise, weak signals |
| 40m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 0000-0600 UTC | Limited DX, local NVIS possible |
| 20m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1400-1800 UTC | Short, weak openings possible |
| 17m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1500-1700 UTC | Occasional brief paths |
| 15m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1600-1700 UTC | Mostly closed, check for sporadic E |
| 12m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1600-1700 UTC | Unlikely to open |
| 10m  | 🔴 Poor       | 🔴 Poor         | 1600-1700 UTC | Closed except rare E-skip |

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **80m/40m:** Try late evening to early morning (2300-0600 UTC) for local/regional contacts.
- **20m:** Watch for short, weak openings around midday to late afternoon (1400-1800 UTC).
- **Higher Bands (15-10m):** Mostly closed, but check around 1600-1700 UTC for any surprises.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **DX is tough today!** High geomagnetic activity is absorbing signals, especially on polar and trans-equatorial paths.
- If you’re chasing DX, try 40m or 20m during their brief best times, focus on east-west paths, and avoid polar routes.
- Look for grayline (sunrise/sunset) enhancements, but expect weak signals.

## 📈 3-Day Forecast

| Day        | K-Index | Propagation Outlook      |
|------------|---------|-------------------------|
| Today      | 4.0     | Poor to Fair, active geomagnetic field |
| Tomorrow   | 3.5-4.5 | Poor to Fair, unsettled/active |
| Day After  | 3.0-5.0 | Poor to Fair, variable, possible improvement if K drops |

- **Summary:** Expect unsettled to active geomagnetic conditions for the next 72 hours. HF propagation will remain poor, with only brief improvements possible if geomagnetic activity decreases.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 40m and 80m for local points. Don’t expect much DX.
- **DXers:** Watch for grayline, but keep expectations low. East-west paths may be slightly better.
- **Casual Operators:** Use digital modes (FT8/FT4) for best chances. Voice and CW will be tough.
- **General:** Monitor the K-index—if it drops below 4, higher bands may briefly improve.

## 🔬 Technical Details

- **Solar Flux Index:** 100.0 (moderate, but not enough to offset geomagnetic disturbance)
- **Sunspot Number:** 133 (decent, but propagation limited by geomagnetic storm)
- **K-index:** 4.0 (active, signals absorbed, especially at high latitudes)
- **A-index:** 0.0 (short-term quiet, but overall field is disturbed)
- **Proton Flux:** 1.26e+05 particles/cm²/s (elevated, can further degrade HF)
- **General:** High geomagnetic activity absorbs HF signals, especially above 20m. Lower bands are noisy.
