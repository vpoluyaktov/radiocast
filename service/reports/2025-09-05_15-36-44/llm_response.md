## 🎯 Quick Summary

Propagation is looking solid for most HF bands today, with moderate solar activity and quiet geomagnetic conditions. The solar flux is healthy at 149, and sunspot numbers remain strong (128), supporting good openings on 20m through 15m, especially during daylight. The K-index is low (mostly 1-2), meaning minimal geomagnetic disturbance—so expect stable conditions, especially for mid- and high-latitude operators. Higher bands (12m/10m) are fair during the day but drop off at night, while 40m and 80m are best after sunset. Now is a great time to chase DX on 17m and 20m!

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{SUN_GIF}}

- **Solar Flux (10.7 cm radio energy):** 149 — This is a strong value, supporting good ionization for HF propagation.
- **Sunspot Number:** 128 — Consistently high, indicating an active sun and good band openings.
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers have dipped from their early-year peaks but remain robust for late-cycle conditions.
- **No major solar flares** reported, so no sudden blackouts or disruptions expected.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

{{BAND_CONDITIONS_CHART}}

- **80m & 40m:** 🟡 Fair during the day, 🟢 Good at night. Expect solid regional and some DX after sunset.
- **30m & 20m:** 🟢 Good day and night. 20m is your best all-around band for both local and DX.
- **17m & 15m:** 🟢 Good day and night. Great for daytime DX, especially on east-west paths.
- **12m & 10m:** 🟡 Fair during the day, 🔴 Poor at night. Watch for short, sporadic daytime openings—especially if you’re in lower latitudes or during peak solar hours.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{K_INDEX_CHART}}

- **K-index:** Currently 1-2, with no recent spikes. This means the Earth's magnetic field is quiet and stable.
- **Recent Trend:** After a minor disturbance (K=5) two days ago, things have settled down nicely.
- **Impact:** Low K means less auroral absorption and better high-latitude propagation. Expect minimal fading or flutter on signals.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Daytime (10:00–18:00 local):** 20m, 17m, and 15m are wide open for DX. 12m/10m may open briefly around local noon, especially for north-south paths.
- **Late Afternoon/Evening (16:00–22:00):** 20m and 17m remain strong; 40m starts to come alive for regional and some DX.
- **Night (22:00–06:00):** 40m and 80m are your best bets for both local and long-haul contacts. 20m may stay open late, especially toward sunrise.
- **Greyline (dawn/dusk):** Watch for enhanced propagation on 40m and 20m, especially for east-west DX.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best Bands for DX:** 20m and 17m are your go-to bands for reliable long-distance contacts all day and into the evening.
- **15m:** Good for daytime DX, especially toward equatorial and southern regions.
- **10m/12m:** Watch for short, sporadic openings—especially on north-south paths and during peak solar hours.
- **40m:** Opens up for DX at night, especially during the greyline.
- **Geographic Patterns:** East-west paths (Europe <-> NA, Asia <-> NA) are strong on 20m/17m. North-south paths may see surprise openings on 10m/12m.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{FORECAST_CHART}}

- **Solar Activity:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers are expected to remain steady, supporting continued good HF conditions.
- **Geomagnetic Field:** K-index forecast to stay low (1-2), so stable propagation should persist.
- **HF Bands:** 20m–15m will remain strong; 10m/12m may improve if solar flux ticks up further.
- **No major space weather alerts**—enjoy the quiet!

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during the day for high rates; move to 40m and 80m at night.
- **DXers:** Check 17m and 20m for all-day DX. Monitor 10m/12m around noon for surprise openings.
- **Casual Operators:** 20m is your most reliable band for both local and international QSOs.
- **Digital Modes:** FT8/FT4 will help you exploit marginal 10m/12m openings.
- **Antennas:** If you have directional antennas, point them east-west during the day, and try north-south on 10m/12m for rare paths.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancement expected—stick to local FM and repeaters.
