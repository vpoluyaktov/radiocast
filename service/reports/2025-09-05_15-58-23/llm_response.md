## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is looking solid today! Solar activity is moderate with a solar flux of 149 and sunspot numbers in the 120s, supporting good daytime openings on 20m–17m and fair conditions on 15m–10m. Geomagnetic activity is low (K=2), so expect stable bands and great opportunities for DX, especially during daylight hours.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{SUN_GIF}}

- **Solar Flux:** 149 (radio energy from the sun; higher means better HF propagation)
- **Sunspot Number:** 128 (plenty of sunspots, which is good for ionization)
- **Recent Trend:** Solar flux and sunspot numbers have rebounded from a dip in May/June, now holding steady in the 120–140 range.
- **Space Weather:** No major solar flares or proton events reported. The sun is active enough to keep the higher bands open, but not so active as to cause disruptions.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

{{BAND_TABLE}}

- **80m–40m:** 🟡 Fair during the day, 🟢 Good at night. Great for local and regional contacts after sunset; daytime D-layer absorption limits range.
- **30m–20m:** 🟢 Good day and night. These are your workhorse bands right now—reliable for both DX and casual QSOs nearly 24/7.
- **17m–15m:** 🟢 Good day and night. Expect solid openings, especially for east-west and equatorial paths.
- **12m–10m:** 🟠 Fair during the day, 🔴 Poor at night. 10m may open for short periods midday, especially on north-south paths, but is mostly closed after dark.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{K_INDEX_CHART}}

- **Current K-index:** 2 (quiet)
- **Recent Trend:** After a brief spike (K=5) two days ago, geomagnetic activity has settled down and remained low.
- **Impact:** Low K means stable conditions—signals will be less likely to fade or flutter, and auroral interference is minimal. Great news for all HF operators!

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **20m/17m:** Open sunrise to sunset and into the evening. Best for DX and long-haul QSOs.
- **15m/12m/10m:** Try late morning to mid-afternoon (local time) for best chances, especially for north-south DX.
- **40m/80m:** Best after local sunset through sunrise for regional and some DX contacts.
- **Grayline (dawn/dusk):** Excellent for chasing DX on 30m–20m as the sun rises or sets.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best Bands for DX:** 20m, 17m, and 15m are your top choices. 20m and 17m are open nearly around the clock, while 15m can deliver surprises during the day.
- **Paths:** East-west (Europe–Americas, Asia–Americas) and north-south (South America, Africa, Oceania) are favored.
- **10m:** Watch for sporadic E or short-lived F2 openings midday—especially if you hear beacons or FT8 activity.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{FORECAST_CHART}}

- **Solar Activity:** Expected to remain moderate; solar flux and sunspots stable.
- **Geomagnetic Activity:** K-index forecast to stay low (K=1–2), so no major disturbances expected.
- **Propagation Outlook:** 20m–17m will continue to be reliable. 15m and 12m will be variable but worth checking during the day. 10m will open only briefly, if at all.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancements expected.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{PROPAGATION_TIMELINE_CHART}}

- **Daytime:** 20m–15m open for DX; 10m possible for short periods.
- **Evening/Night:** 40m–80m come alive for regional and some long-haul contacts.
- **Early Morning/Grayline:** Enhanced DX on 30m–20m.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during the day for rate; 40m and 80m at night for multipliers.
- **DXers:** Check 17m and 15m for rare DX, especially around grayline. Use FT8/FT4 for weak openings on 10m and 12m.
- **Casual Ops:** 20m is your all-day, all-purpose band. Try 40m after dark for local nets and ragchews.
- **Mobile/Portable:** 20m and 17m are forgiving and productive with modest antennas right now.
- **VHF/UHF:** No special propagation modes expected; stick to local FM, repeaters, and satellites.
