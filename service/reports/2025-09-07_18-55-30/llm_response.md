## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is fairly stable today with moderate solar activity and low geomagnetic disturbance. Expect good conditions on 20m–15m during the day, while 80m–40m will shine at night. Higher bands (12m–10m) may be spotty, so focus on mid-bands for reliable contacts.

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.SunGif}}

- **Solar Flux (radio energy from the sun):** 133
- **Sunspot Number:** 83 (recent months have averaged 120–130, so this is a bit below recent peaks)
- **Solar Activity:** No major flares or proton events reported. The sun is moderately active, supporting decent HF propagation.
- **Trends:** Solar flux has dipped from earlier highs but is holding steady, supporting mid-to-high band openings.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band   | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Operating Times     | Notes                                                                                  |
|--------|:-------------:|:---------------:|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 80m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Local night, sunrise    | Good for local/regional nets after dark. Some QRN (static) possible.                   |
| 40m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, early morning    | NVIS/local strong at night; some daytime skip possible.                                |
| 20m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to sunset  | Reliable for DX and domestic; open most of the day and into early evening.             |
| 17m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Midday to late afternoon| Good for DX; less crowded, stable signals.                                             |
| 15m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning to afternoon| Solid for international contacts, especially during daylight.                          |
| 12m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon         | Occasional openings; check for short-lived DX, especially on east-west paths.          |
| 10m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon         | Sporadic E possible, but generally weak. Monitor for brief openings.                   |

**Analysis:**  
- **Best bands today:** 20m, 17m, and 15m are your go-to bands for reliable daytime and early evening operation, with good potential for both domestic and DX contacts.
- **Challenging bands:** 12m and 10m may open briefly in the afternoon but will be inconsistent. 80m and 40m are your best bets after sunset for local/regional work.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

- **K-index:** Currently 1–2 (quiet), after a brief spike to 5 (minor storm) yesterday.
- **Trend:** The geomagnetic field is now calm, which is great news for HF propagation. The recent disturbance may have caused some fading or absorption, but conditions are recovering.

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **Daytime (10:00–18:00 local):** 20m, 17m, and 15m are open and reliable for DX and domestic contacts.
- **Late afternoon (16:00–20:00):** 20m remains strong, 17m/15m begin to fade.
- **Evening/night (20:00–06:00):** 40m and 80m come alive for local/regional QSOs and some longer skip.
- **Early morning (sunrise):** 40m and 80m are quietest, good for grayline DX.

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best DX bands:** 17m and 15m during midday for intercontinental paths, especially east-west.
- **20m:** Consistent for worldwide contacts, especially during late morning and afternoon.
- **Grayline (sunrise/sunset):** Try 40m and 80m for enhanced long-path DX.
- **10m/12m:** Check for short, sporadic openings—especially if you hear beacons or strong signals from southern latitudes.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar flux:** Expected to remain steady (130–135), supporting continued good mid-band propagation.
- **Geomagnetic field:** Should remain quiet (K=1–2), with no major storms forecast.
- **HF conditions:** 20m–15m will continue to be reliable; 10m/12m may improve if solar flux ticks up or if sporadic E occurs.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancement expected.

**Recommendations:**  
- Focus on 20m–15m for DX and contesting.
- Monitor 10m/12m for surprise openings, especially during peak solar hours.
- Night owls: 80m/40m will be your best bet for local and some DX.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- **Day:** 20m–15m open for DX, 40m/80m close up.
- **Night:** 40m/80m open up, higher bands fade.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Concentrate on 20m, 17m, and 15m during the day for rate and multipliers. Use 40m/80m after dark.
- **DXers:** Check 17m and 15m midday for rare DX. Try 40m/80m at grayline for long-path opportunities.
- **Casual ops:** 20m will be the most consistent for ragchews and nets.
- **VHF/UHF:** No special propagation modes expected—stick to local repeaters and FM simplex.
