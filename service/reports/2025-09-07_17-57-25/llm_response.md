## 🎯 Quick Summary

HF propagation is looking solid today with a solar flux of 133 and sunspot numbers in the low 80s, supporting good conditions on most bands. Geomagnetic activity has settled after a recent spike, so expect improved openings on 20m–15m during the day and reliable low-band performance at night. Now’s a great time to try for DX, especially on 17m and 20m!

## 📊 Current Solar Activity

{{.SunGif}}

Solar flux (the sun’s radio energy output) is at **133**, which is healthy for HF propagation. The current sunspot number is **83**, showing the Sun is still active enough to support good ionization. No major solar flares have been reported, and both proton and electron flux are quiet, so there’s minimal risk of sudden blackouts or absorption events.

Recent months show a slight dip in sunspot numbers but still well above solar minimum, keeping the higher bands open during daylight hours.

## 📻 Band-by-Band Analysis

| Band   | Day Condition | Night Condition | Best Times           | Notes                                                                 |
|--------|:-------------:|:---------------:|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 80m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, early morning | Quiet geomagnetic field = low noise. Good for local/regional QSOs.    |
| 40m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🟡 Good         | Night, sunrise/sunset| Nighttime DX possible, especially after local midnight.                |
| 20m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Late morning–sunset  | Reliable worldwide DX, especially east-west paths.                     |
| 17m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟡 Good         | Midday–early evening | Excellent for DX, less crowded than 20m.                               |
| 15m    | 🟡 Good       | 🟠 Fair         | Late morning–afternoon| Open for DX, especially to equatorial and southern latitudes.          |
| 12m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon      | Some sporadic openings; check for short skip and DX.                   |
| 10m    | 🟠 Fair       | 🔴 Poor         | Early afternoon      | Occasional short openings, especially during solar peak hours.         |

**Analysis:**  
- **Best daytime bands:** 20m, 17m, and 15m are all 🟡 Good, with 20m and 17m offering the most consistent DX.
- **Best nighttime bands:** 40m and 80m improve after sunset, with 40m offering some DX potential.
- **Challenging bands:** 12m and 10m are only 🟠 Fair during peak solar hours and mostly closed at night, but worth checking for brief openings.

## 📈 Geomagnetic Conditions

{{.KIndexChart}}

The K-index (a measure of geomagnetic disturbance) spiked to **5** (minor storm) yesterday but has since dropped to a quiet **1–2** range. This means the ionosphere is recovering, and absorption is low, so HF propagation is stabilizing. Expect improved conditions, especially for polar and trans-auroral paths.

---

## ⏰ Best Operating Times

- **20m/17m/15m:** Late morning through sunset for worldwide DX.
- **40m/80m:** After sunset through sunrise for regional and some long-haul contacts.
- **10m/12m:** Early afternoon for possible short openings—listen for beacons and weak signals.

Peak propagation is expected during local midday and early evening on the higher bands.

---

## 🌍 DX Opportunities

- **Best bands for DX:** 20m and 17m—look for openings to Europe, Africa, and South America during your local afternoon and evening.
- **15m:** Good for trans-equatorial paths and southern hemisphere DX.
- **40m:** Nighttime DX possible, especially on grayline.
- **10m/12m:** Try for sporadic E or short-skip DX during early afternoon, especially if you hear beacons.

## 🔮 3-Day Forecast

{{.ForecastChart}}

- **Solar flux** expected to remain in the 130s, supporting continued good HF propagation.
- **Geomagnetic activity** should stay quiet (K=1–2), with no major storms forecast.
- **HF conditions**: 20m–15m will remain reliable for DX during daylight; 40m/80m strong at night.
- **10m/12m**: Watch for brief openings, especially if solar flux ticks up.

## 📡 Propagation Timeline

{{.PropagationTimelineChart}}

- **Morning:** 40m and 80m strong for local/regional; 20m/17m opening for DX.
- **Afternoon:** 20m/17m/15m best for worldwide DX; check 10m/12m for short openings.
- **Evening:** 20m/17m fade; 40m/80m take over for nighttime contacts.

## 💡 Operator Tips

- **Contesters:** Focus on 20m and 15m during the day for high rates; 40m at night for multipliers.
- **DXers:** Try 17m for less crowded DX; check 10m/12m for surprise openings.
- **Casual ops:** 40m and 20m will be reliable most of the day and night.
- **VHF/UHF:** No significant tropospheric or auroral enhancement expected—normal local coverage.
